Description:
	This project aims for tracking and displacing the squirrels in Central
Park in web applications. We imported and used '2018 Central Park Squirrel Census'
data as our reference to build and demonstrate this project.

Functions:
	Our project has the following functions:
1)	/map	
	that supports viewing the locations of the a few squirrels on a street map.

2)	/sightings
	that lists all of the squirrels in our database with dates and a link to their details.

3)	/sightings/<uniqu_squirrel_id>
	that displays more detailed information about the selected squirrel.

4)	/admin	
	the admin page for adding/deleting/changing a new squirrel with certain attributes.

5)	/sightings/stats
	that displays the general statistics of the whole data set we wish to demonstrate.
